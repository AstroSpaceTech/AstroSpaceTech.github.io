PROLOGUE:
When I was a child I often think that one day I'll plan on travelling to the stars.It intrigued what lies beyond the stars,how we could terraform on stars.Hitherto,my mind is flummox whenever talking about the space exploration.It overwhelms and hypnotize in pretext of Space.Space is for everybody. It's not just for a few people in science or math, or for a select group of astronauts. That's our new frontier out there, and it's everybody's business to know about space.Take a breathe!

Have you ever ask yourself 'Where will human civilization be fifty thousand years into the future?What is our ultimate destiny?
Now that the Kepler spacecraft and teams of Earth-bound astronomers have discovered about four thousand planets orbiting other stars in the Milky Way galaxy.In 2017,NASA scientists identified not one but seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a nearby star a mere thirty-nine light-years from Earth.Of these seven  planets,three of them are closed enough to their mother star to support liquid water.Very soon,astronomers will be able to confirm whether or not these and other planets have atmospheres containing water vapour.Since water is the "universal solvent" capable of being the mixing bowl for the organic chemicals that make up the DNA molecule,scientists may be able to show that the conditions for life are common in the universe.Around the same time,astronomers made another game-changing discovery,an Earth-sized planet named Proxima Centauri b,which orbits the star closest to our sun,which is just 4.2 light-years away from us.Many astronomers believe that if you can imagine any bizarre formation of planets,then it probably exists somewhere in the galaxy,as long as it doesn't violate some law of physics.This means that we can roughly calculate how many Earth-sized planets there in the galaxy.Since it has about one hundred billion stars,there might be twenty billion Earth-sized planets orbiting a sun like star in our galaxy alone.And since there are one hundred billion billion galaxies that can be seen with our instruments,we can estimate how many Earth-sized planets there are in the visble universe:a staggering two billion trillion.
Realizing that the galaxy could be teeming with habitable planets,you will never see the night sky in the same way again.Such a discovery would be one of the turning points in human history,comparable to taming of fire.Not only it redefine our relationship to the rest of the universe,it would also change our destiny.
History reveals that scientific revolutions come in waves,often stimulated by advances in physics.In the nineteenth century,the first wave of science and technology was made possible by physicists who created the theory of mechanics and thermodynamics.This enabled engineers to produce the steam engine,leading to the locomotive and the industrial revolution.
In the twentieth century,the second wave was spearheaded by physicists who mastered the laws of electricity and magnetism,which in turn ushered in the electric age.This made possible the electrification of our cities with the advent of dynamos,generators,TV,
radio,and radar.The second wave gave birth to the modern space program,which took us to the moon.
In the twenty-first century,the third wave of science has been expressed in high tech,spearheaded by the quantum physicists who invented the transistor and the laser.This made possible the supercomputer,the internet,modern telecommunications and GPS.
In future,we will have to exploit the fourth wave of science,which consists of artificial intelligence,
nanotechnology,and biotechnology.The goal of terraform Mars exceeds our capability today,but the technologies of the twenty-second century will allow us to turn this bleak,frozen desert into a habitable world.
If our ancestors could see us today,what would they think?
For most of human history,we lived wretched lives,struggling in a hostile,uncaring world where life expectancy was between twenty and thirty years of age.We were mostly nomads,carrying all our possessions on our backs.Every day was a struggle to secure food and shelter.We lived in a constant fear of vicious predator,disease,and hunger.But if our ancestors could see us today,with our ability to send images instantly across the planet,with rockets that can take us to the moon and beyond,and with cars that car drive themselves,they would consider us to be sorcerers and magicians.
If our ancestors in the last century would think of us today as magicians and sorcerers,then how might we view our descendants a century from now?
More than likely,we would consider our descendants to be like Greek gods.Like Mercury,they would be able to soar into space to visit nearby planets.Like Venus,they would have perfect immortal bodies.Like Apollo,they would have unlimited access to the sun's energy.Like Zeus,they would be able to issue mental commands and have their wishes come true.And they would be able to conjure up mythical animals like Pegasus using genetic engineering.
In other words,our destiny is to become the gods that we once feared and worshipped.Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image.The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power.
Humanity is about to embark on perhaps its greatest adventure.And the first step we take in our long journey to the stars begins when we leave the earth.As the old Chinese proverb says,the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.The journey to the stars begins with the very first rocketðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€To conclude this write-up,let's put Larry Niven saying,""The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space program.And if we become extinct because we don't have a space program,it'll serve us right"
