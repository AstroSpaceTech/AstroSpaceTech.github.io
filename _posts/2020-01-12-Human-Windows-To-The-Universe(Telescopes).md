Astronomers use telescopes to learn about the universe. Since the time of Galileo, optical telescopes have grown in aperture from a centimeter to ten meters, and astronomers have put telescopes in space and have used them to detect electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths not visible to the eye.


 ADVANTAGES OF LARGE TELESCOPE(HUBBLE TELESCOPE)

1.Hubble made a huge impact discovery that every galaxy in the universe has a supermassive black hole(including our own galaxy-Milky Way)
2.Provided black holes are real
3.Discovered dark energy
4.Found galaxies near the dawn of time
5.Deepest views of the universe
6.Determined the age of the universe.

REASONS ASTRONOMERS WANT TO PUT TELESCOPE IN SPACE

Due to three limitations imposed on ground based Astronomy.
1. One is caused by light pollution that is omnipresent in urban and suburban areas of the world.
2. The second limitation is the blurring of the Earth's atmosphere.
3. The third limitation is the opacity of the Earth's atmosphere to most forms of electromagnetic radiation.
Except for the small silver of visible waves and a large chunk of radio spectrum, all other bands of electromagnetic radiation are extinguished by the Earth's atmosphere. To observe them, we have to go into space.

Moreover,some examples of wavelengths regions beyond the spectrum of visible light where astronomers can learn about the universe are :
1. Spitzer Space Telescope use for studying infrared wavelengths.
2. Chandra X-ray and Hubble are used for comets to cosmology.
3. WMAP Satellite use for studying microwave background radiation
4. LISA(Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) use to detect gravity waves
