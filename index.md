AstroSpaceTech is the only  and first international platform which will provide Space Education in vernacular language. It aims to enlighten the world in the fields of Astronomy & Space Technology especially for high school students, public and non-techical backgrounds. We wanted this platform not only to solve the problems face by undergrads students for providing opportunity to do their projects, trainings, internships,classes(offline/online) and get work experiences.We are also aiming to touch the Stars in the future with our own rocket. We believe the future is in the stars. Are you with us? 

> I don’t think the human race will survive the next 1,000 years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I’m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars. – Stephen Hawking


**WHY IS THE PROBLEM WE ARE SOLVING IMPORTANT AND HOW DOES IT HELP HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION?**

According to Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964.He categorised civilizations based on the energy consumption or use.
Type 1 civilization utilizes all the energy of the sunlight that falls on that planet.
Type 2 civilization utilizes all the energy its sun produces
A Type 3 civilization utilizes the energy of an entire galaxy.
By mathematically computation of the energy consumption,we are currently in Type 0.7 civilization. Therefore, the problem we are solving today determines the next civilisation. The uniqueness of AstroSpaceTech is to give you subject matter experts(mentorships) in the fields of Space Education.We are designing courses to educate billions of people which you be able to access in your own vernacular langauge with affordable prices. This will inspire thousands of students to pursue a career in Astronomy & Space Technology.When half of the population understands the important of scientific knnowledge  there will be big market in Astronomy & Space Technology. This will not only help  Space Companies in the world but also  help to foster a peaceful connection with other nations. Then, there will be billions of people to support Human Space Exploration. That is why, we are planning to educate first public and undergrads students and then plan to mission stars. 

> I would not see our candle blown out in the wind. It is a small thing, this dear gift of life handed us mysteriously out of immensity. I would not have that gift expire… If I seem to be beating a dead horse again and again, I must protest: No! I am beating, again and again, living man to keep him awake and move his limbs and jump his mind… What’s the use of looking at Mars through a telescope, sitting on panels, writing books, if it isn’t to guarantee, not just the survival of mankind, but mankind surviving forever! – Ray Bradbury, Mars and the Mind of Man, 1971

**WHAT ARE EXCITING MILESTONE COMING UP FOR ASTROSPACETECH?**

A major milestone for us will come in by the end of this year(2020) to finish our products which will be available to access anywhere in the world. Stay tuned! 

**WHAT ARE SOME ACHIEVEMENTS WE ARE PROUD OF?**

We are really happy to announce that there are more than 500+ students attempted our online quiz on "ADVANCE IN ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS" .Out of 500+ students there are around 250 students passed the minimum score and get certification. Currently, there are more than twenty countries using our site. 

**HOW CAN THE PUBLIC SUPPORT US WITH OUR MISSION?**

We will need to hire software developer/hacker, Android Developer and like minded people who supports our goals and mission can send us your CV/resume if you wish to join.Also, we are looking for advisory board for AstroSpaceTech please do contact us if you support our goals. Send your CV/resume:kuki@astrospacetech.in

Since we started this start-up with bootstrapping you can help to donate us or join us as volunteers.

**HOW DID THE IDEA OF ASTROSPACETECH COME?**

 Since childhood I'm interested in what should be out there in space, the formation of stars, why do the sun shines, will there be any life out there, why do the Earth revolves around the Sun, how did the universe begin, what is the fate of the universe, are we alone in the universe, what is the fate of the humanity and so on. I asked myself several  questions regarding about space. I used to sit dusk to dawn gazing at the stars with naked eyes. Through my imagination I used to travel from one star to another stars because I believed knowledge is limited and imagination encircles the world. I was brought up in small village in North Eastern part of India(Manipur).Since there were no proper transportation, no internet connectivity and not a single person had telescopes and know about astronomy and space technology in my village. The only solution left was to learn by myself. During those days, I wish there were at least Astronomy & Space Technology books/courses written in vernacular language but my hope was belied. Since that day onwards, I have been thinking in my mind one day  to open a platform for people who are passionate to learn about Space. I left my village to continue my higher education in town and then moved to different state to achieve my goal. On this short span of journey, I learnt not only employers wanted students having skills with certification but also work experiences too. I often heard mostly from engineering grads students  finding  jobs for freshers is hard due to lack of work experiences. If the employers don't hire freshers how could freshers get experiences , right? This is the major problem face by Indian engineering students . In order to avoid such unwanted situation one must have to find a way to get rid off, right? Today, I have an ideas where you can get work experiences with us. Keeping in mind that, I presented my childhood ideas to execute into reality.

Since our aims to enlighten the world in Astronomy & Space Technology we want to connect with as many as like minded people. Feel free to connect with us. 

If you support our goals and mission you can work with us by sending your resume/CV without paying zero amount.

LET'S BUILD BRIDGE FOR EVERYONE
                   &
BE  A MULTI-PLANETARY        SPECIES!
