    "title": "Is there a GOD?",
    "body": "2019/09/06 - We were told that you never get something for nothing. But now, after a lifetime of work, I think that actually you can get a whole universe for free. The great mystery at the heart of the Big Bang is to explain how an entire, fantastically enormous universe of space and energy can materialise out of nothing. The secret lies in one of the strangest facts about our cosmos. The laws of physics demand the existence of something called ‘negative energy’. To help you get your head around this weird but crucial concept, let me draw on a simple analogy. Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill – he’s also making a hole, in effect a negative version of the hill. The stuff that was in the hole has now become the hill, so it all perfectly balances out. This is the principle behind what happened at the beginning of the universe. When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. In this way, the positive and the negative add up to zero, always. It’s another law of nature. So where is all this negative energy today? It’s in the third ingredient in our cosmic cookbook: it’s in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion – laws that are among the oldest in science – space itself is a vast store of negative energy. Enough to ensure that everything adds up to zero. I’ll admit that, unless mathematics is your thing, this is hard to grasp, but it’s true. The endless web of billions upon billions of galaxies, each pulling on each other by the force of gravity, acts like a giant storage device. The universe is like an enormous battery storing negative energy. The positive side of things – the mass and energy we see today – is like the hill. The corresponding hole, or negative side of things, is spread throughout space. People want answers to the big questions, like why we are here. They don’t expect the answers to be easy, so they are prepared to struggle a bit. When people ask me if a God created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s liuke asking for directions to the edge of the Earth – the Earth is a sphere that doesn’t have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise. Do I have faith? We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation: there is probably no heaven and afterlife either. I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful. _____Source: BIG ANSWERS TO THE BRIEF QUESTIONS by Stephen Hawking. "

    "body": "2019/09/05 - The Orion Nebula is a famous diffuse emission/reflection nebula located in the constellation Orion. It is also known as Messier 42 (M42) or the Great Orion Nebula. Its designation in the New General Catalogue is NGC 1976. The brightest stars in the nebula form an asterism known as the Trapezium Cluster. These young stars are responsible for most of the nebula’s glow. The Orion Nebula is one of the brightest nebulae in the night sky and, lying at a distance of 1,344 light years, it is the nearest region of massive star formation to Earth. It can be seen without binoculars, and its brightness and proximity make M42 one of the most studied objects in the night sky. The nebulous region of M42 is easily seen through binoculars or a small telescope. The best time of year to observe the nebula is the winter, during the months of December and January, when Orion constellation is high in the sky. Astronomers studying the nebula have learned a lot about the formation of stars and planetary systems from collapsing dust and gas clouds, and they have observed the effects of massive stars photo-ionizing the clouds in the nebula. They have also discovered what they believe are some of the younger protostars ever found. The Orion Nebula spans a degree in the sky, and includes stellar associations, reflection nebulae, dust and gas clouds, and ionized volumes of gas. FACTS AND LOCATIONOrion Nebula (Messier 42) – In one of the most detailed astronomical images ever produced, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captured an unprecedented look at the Orion Nebula. This turbulent star formation region is one of astronomy’s most dramatic and photogenic celestial objects. More than 3,000 stars of various sizes appear in this image. Some of them have never been seen in visible light. These stars reside in a dramatic dust-and-gas landscape of plateaus, mountains, and valleys that are reminiscent of the Grand Canyon. "

The tails of meteors,which point away from the direction of motion,are caused by air friction. On a clear night,you might see a meteor every few minutes simply by gazing upward. METEORITES: A rock that actually land on Earth is called a meteorite. ASTEROIDS: Asteroids are rocky debris in the solar system. Most of them are are contained in the asteroid belt and are remnants of a failed planet between Mars and Jupiter. If you were to add up the masses of all the known asteroids,the sum would only amount to 4 percent of the mass of the moon. For the most part,asteroids remain in stable orbits in the asteroid belt,but occasionally one strays and hits the Earth’s atmosphere and burns up as a meteor. COMET: A comet is a piece of ice and rock that originates far beyond the orbit of the Earth. While asteroids lie within the solar system,many comets actually orbit in the outer fringes of the solar system,in the Kuiper Belt,or even outside the solar system itself,in the Oort Cloud. The comets we see in the night sky are those whose orbit or trajectory had brought them near the Sun🌞🚀 Ref:Mining the Heavens p-55-71,The Future of Humanity by Michio Kaku "

    "body": "2019/09/03 - PROLOGUE:When I was a child I often think that one day I’ll plan on travelling to the stars. It intrigued what lies beyond the stars,how we could terraform on stars. Hitherto,my mind is flummox whenever talking about the space exploration. It overwhelms and hypnotize in pretext of Space. Space is for everybody. It’s not just for a few people in science or math, or for a select group of astronauts. That’s our new frontier out there, and it’s everybody’s business to know about space. Take a breathe! Have you ever ask yourself ‘Where will human civilization be fifty thousand years into the future?What is our ultimate destiny?Now that the Kepler spacecraft and teams of Earth-bound astronomers have discovered about four thousand planets orbiting other stars in the Milky Way galaxy. In 2017,NASA scientists identified not one but seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a nearby star a mere thirty-nine light-years from Earth. Of these seven planets,three of them are closed enough to their mother star to support liquid water. Very soon,astronomers will be able to confirm whether or not these and other planets have atmospheres containing water vapour. Since water is the “universal solvent” capable of being the mixing bowl for the organic chemicals that make up the DNA molecule,scientists may be able to show that the conditions for life are common in the universe. Around the same time,astronomers made another game-changing discovery,an Earth-sized planet named Proxima Centauri b,which orbits the star closest to our sun,which is just 4. 2 light-years away from us. Many astronomers believe that if you can imagine any bizarre formation of planets,then it probably exists somewhere in the galaxy,as long as it doesn’t violate some law of physics. This means that we can roughly calculate how many Earth-sized planets there in the galaxy. Since it has about one hundred billion stars,there might be twenty billion Earth-sized planets orbiting a sun like star in our galaxy alone. And since there are one hundred billion billion galaxies that can be seen with our instruments,we can estimate how many Earth-sized planets there are in the visble universe:a staggering two billion trillion. Realizing that the galaxy could be teeming with habitable planets,you will never see the night sky in the same way again. Such a discovery would be one of the turning points in human history,comparable to taming of fire. Not only it redefine our relationship to the rest of the universe,it would also change our destiny. History reveals that scientific revolutions come in waves,often stimulated by advances in physics. In the nineteenth century,the first wave of science and technology was made possible by physicists who created the theory of mechanics and thermodynamics. This enabled engineers to produce the steam engine,leading to the locomotive and the industrial revolution. In the twentieth century,the second wave was spearheaded by physicists who mastered the laws of electricity and magnetism,which in turn ushered in the electric age. This made possible the electrification of our cities with the advent of dynamos,generators,TV,radio,and radar. The second wave gave birth to the modern space program,which took us to the moon. In the twenty-first century,the third wave of science has been expressed in high tech,spearheaded by the quantum physicists who invented the transistor and the laser. This made possible the supercomputer,the internet,modern telecommunications and GPS. In future,we will have to exploit the fourth wave of science,which consists of artificial intelligence,nanotechnology,and biotechnology. The goal of terraform Mars exceeds our capability today,but the technologies of the twenty-second century will allow us to turn this bleak,frozen desert into a habitable world. If our ancestors could see us today,what would they think?For most of human history,we lived wretched lives,struggling in a hostile,uncaring world where life expectancy was between twenty and thirty years of age. We were mostly nomads,carrying all our possessions on our backs. Every day was a struggle to secure food and shelter. We lived in a constant fear of vicious predator,disease,and hunger. But if our ancestors could see us today,with our ability to send images instantly across the planet,with rockets that can take us to the moon and beyond,and with cars that car drive themselves,they would consider us to be sorcerers and magicians. If our ancestors in the last century would think of us today as magicians and sorcerers,then how might we view our descendants a century from now?More than likely,we would consider our descendants to be like Greek gods. Like Mercury,they would be able to soar into space to visit nearby planets. Like Venus,they would have perfect immortal bodies. Like Apollo,they would have unlimited access to the sun’s energy. Like Zeus,they would be able to issue mental commands and have their wishes come true. And they would be able to conjure up mythical animals like Pegasus using genetic engineering. In other words,our destiny is to become the gods that we once feared and worshipped. Science will give us the means by which we can shape the universe in our image. The question is whether we will have the wisdom of Solomon to accompany this vast celestial power. Humanity is about to embark on perhaps its greatest adventure. And the first step we take in our long journey to the stars begins when we leave the earth. As the old Chinese proverb says,the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. The journey to the stars begins with the very first rocket🚀🚀🚀To conclude this write-up,let’s put Larry Niven saying,”“The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn’t have a space program. And if we become extinct because we don’t have a space program,it’ll serve us right” "

    "body": "2019/09/02 - The present era is the era of science. Science has undoubtedly done a great service to mankind. Man, a rational being, has been curious to explore mysteries of nature and this led to many discoveries being made in various part of the world. But he is never satisfied with the acquired knowledge and is always keen to unravelled mysteries of the universe. He has conquered the land and air. His incredible lust for knowledge has revolutionized human life and raised the standard of life. He was able to invent innumerable ways of making his life comfortable and happy. Every sphere of life has been revolutionized by science. Science asks numerous questions, would it be possible to walk through walls? To build starship that can travel faster than the speed of light? To read other people’s minds? To become invisible? To move objects with the power of our minds?To transport our bodies instantly through outer space? Where did the universe come from,and where is it going?Did the universe have a beginning,and if so,where is it going?Did the universe have a beginning,and if so,what happened before then?What is the nature of time?Will it ever come to an end? and so on… Getting a science education in the 21st century can be very beneficial to children of all ages. Science is what makes up the world and the only way you would be able to know that would be by getting a real education in the studies of science. There are many reasons in why getting an education in science can be important and three of them are that it makes you smarter, it gives you ability to think out of the box, and getting a proper education in science let you understands almost everything in cosmos from atom to universe. Everybody goes to school to extend their knowledge, but studying science helps youths understand the world. To emphasize, science can simply make you more intelligent. In addition to that, learning science can also inform mankind of all ages about what is going on in the world. Our history reveals that scientific revolutions come in waves,often stimulated by advances in physics. In the nineteenth century,the first wave of science and technology was made possible by physicists who created the theory of mechanics and thermodynamics. This enabled engineers to produce the steam engine,leading to the locomotive and the industrial revolution. In the twentieth century,the second wave was spearheaded by physicists who mastered the laws of electricity and magnetism,which in turn ushered in the electric age. This made possible the electrification of our cities with the advent of dynamos,generators,TV,radio,and radar. The second wave gave birth to the modern space program,which took us to the moon. In the twenty-first century,the third wave of science has been expressed in high tech,spearheaded by the quantum physicists who invented the transistor and the laser. This made possible the supercomputer,the internet,modern telecommunications and GPS. In future,we will have to exploit the fourth wave of science,which consists of artificial intelligence,nanotechnology,and biotechnology. The goal of terraform Mars exceeds our capability today,but the technologies of the twenty-second century will allow us to turn this bleak,frozen desert into a habitable world. Think back 150 years to those technological advances that were declared “impossible” by scientists at the time and that have now become part of our everyday lives. Jules Verne wrote a novel in 1863, Paris in the Twentieth Century, which was locked away and forgotten for over a century until it was accidentally discovered by his great-grandson and published for the first time in 1994. In it Verne predicted what Paris might look like in the year 1960. His novel was filled with technology that was clearly considered impossible in the nineteenth century, including fax machines, a world-wide communications network, glass skyscrapers, gas-powered automobiles, and high-speed elevated trains. Lord Kelvin, perhaps the most prominent physicist of the Victorian era (he is buried next to Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey), declared that “heavier than air” devices such as the airplane were impossible. He thought X-rays were a hoax and that radio had no future. Lord Rutherford, who discovered the nucleus of the atom, dismissed the possibility of building an atomic bomb, comparing it to “moonshine. ” Chemists of the nineteenth century declared the search for the philosopher’s stone, a fabled substance that can turn lead into gold, a scientific dead end. Nineteenth-century chemistry was based on the fundamental immutability of the elements, like lead. Yet with today’s atom smashers, we can, in principle, turn lead atoms into gold. Think how fantastic today’s televisions, computers, and Internet would have seemed at the turn of the twentieth century. More recently, black holes were once considered to be science fiction. Einstein himself wrote a paper in 1939 that “proved” that black holes could never form. Yet today the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray telescope have revealed thousands of black holes in space. Not only that on April 10 2019,scientists have obtained the first image of a black hole, using Event Horizon Telescope observations of the center of the galaxy M87. The reason that these technologies were deemed “impossibilities” is that the basic laws of physics and science were not known in the nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth. Given the huge gaps in the understanding of science at the time, especially at the atomic level, it’s no wonder such advances were considered impossible. At the end of the nineteenth century, scientists decided that it was “impossible” for the Earth to be billions of years old. Lord Kelvin declared flatly that a molten Earth would cool down in 20 to 40 million years, contradicting the geologists and Darwinian biologists who claimed that the Earth might be billions of years old. The impossible was finally proven to be possible with the discovery of the nuclear force by Madame Curie and others, showing how the center of the Earth, heated by radioactive decay, could indeed be kept molten for billions of years. We ignore the impossible at our peril. In the 1920s and 1930s Robert Goddard, the founder of modern rocketry, was the subject of intense criticism by those who thought that rockets could never travel in outer space. They sarcastically called his pursuit Goddard’s Folly. In 1921 the editors of the New York Times railed against Dr. Goddard’s work: “Professor Goddard does not know the relation between action and reaction and the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react. He seems to lack the basic knowledge ladled out daily in high schools. ” Rockets were impossible, the editors huffed, because there was no air to push against in outer space. Sadly, one head of state did understand the implications of Goddard’s “impossible” rockets-Adolf Hitler. During World War II, Germany’s barrage of impossibly advanced V-2 rockets rained death and destruction on London, almost bringing it to its knees. In the 1930s it was widely believed, even by Einstein, that an atomic bomb was “impossible. ” Physicists knew that there was a tremendous amount of energy locked deep inside the atom’s nucleus, according to Einstein’s equation E = mc2, but the energy released by a single nucleus was too insignificant to consider. But atomic physicist Leo Szilard remembered reading the 1914 H. G. Wells novel, The World Set Free, in which Wells predicted the development of the atomic bomb. In the book he stated that the secret of the atomic bomb would be solved by a physicist in 1933. By chance Szilard stumbled upon this book in 1932. Spurred on by the novel, in 1933, precisely as predicted by Wells some two decades earlier, he hit upon the idea of magnifying the power of a single atom via a chain reaction, so that the energy of splitting a single uranium nucleus could be magnified by many trillions. Szilard then set into motion a series of key experiments and secret negotiations between Einstein and President Franklin Roosevelt that would lead to the Manhattan Project, which built the atomic bomb. Time and again we see that the study of the impossible has opened up entirely new vistas, pushing the boundaries of physics and chemistry and forcing scientists to redefine what they mean by “impossible. ” As Sir William Osier once said, “The philosophies of one age have become the absurdities of the next, and the foolishness of yesterday has become the wisdom of tomorrow. ”Presently,humans transcends the boundaries of planet Earth. Nuclear weapons threaten the survival of humankind. Organisms are increasingly shaped by intelligent design rather than natural selection but in future intelligent design may becomes the basic principle of life and Homo sapiens could be replaced by humans. Many of us might think knowing science is significant aspect for science students and youths. Nope! Science is for everybody. It’s not just for a few people in science or math, or for a select group of astronauts. That’s our new frontier out there, and it’s everybody’s business to know about science especially youths. Youths have immersed potential to use science as a tool for the development of the society and mankind. To cut a long story short,one must be accustomed with science and technology. Science is the key to our future, and if you don’t believe in science, then you’re holding everybody back. "

    "body": "2019/09/01 - As the old Chinese proverb says,the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. The journey to the space starts with the very first rocket🚀 History reveals that scientific revolutions come in waves,often stimulated by advances in physics. In the nineteenth century,the first wave of science and technology was made possible by physicists who created the theory of mechanics and thermodynamics. This enabled engineers to produce the steam engine,leading to the locomotive and the industrial revolution.

In future,we will have to exploit the fourth wave of science,which consists of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology,and biotechnology. The goal of terraform Mars exceeds our capability today,but the technologies of the twenty-second century will allow us to turn this bleak,frozen desert into a habitable world. TSIOLKOVSKY-A LONELY VISIONARYOn his own,he calculated the escape velocity of the Earth-to be twenty five thousand miles per hour. In 1903,he published his famous rocket equation,which allows one to determine the maximum velocity of a rocket,given its weight and fuel supply. The equation revealed that the relationship between speed and fuel is exponential. Normally,one might assume that if you want to double the velocity of a rocket,you simply need to double the amount of fuel. Instead,the amount of fuel you need rises exponentially with the change in velocity,so that enormous amounts of fuel are needed to give extra boost in speed. This exponential made it clear that you would need huge amounts of fuel to leave the Earth. With his formula,Tsiolkovsky-was for the first time able to estimate how much fuel was necessary to go to the moon,long before his vision became reality. Although Tsiolkovsky was too poor to convert his mathematical equations into actual models,the next step was taken by Robert Goddard,who actually built the prototype that would one day form the basis of space travel. Tsiolkovsky’s guiding philosophy was,”The Earth is our cradle,but we cannot be in the cradle forever,” and he believed in a philosophy called cismism,which holds that the future of humanity is to explore outer space. ROBERT GODDARD-FATHER OF ROCKETRYRobert Goddard first became interested in science as a child witnessing the electrification of his hometown. Goddard systematically turned this curiosity into a usable scientific tool by introducing three innovations. First,Goddard experimented with different types of fuels and realized that powered fuel is inefficient. The Chinese had invented gun powder centuries earlier and used it for rockets,but gunpowder burns unevenly and hence rockets remained mainly toys. Second,to replace powered fuel with liquid fuel,which could be precisely controlled so that it burned cleanly and steadily. He built a rocket with two tanks,one containing a fuel,such as alcohol,and the other tank containing an oxidizer,such as liquid oxygen. He realized that as the rocket rose into the sky,it’s fuel tanks were gradually depleted. His next innovation was to introduce multi-stage rockets that discarded spent fuel tanks and therefore could shed some dead weight along the way,vastly increasing their range and efficiency. And third,he introduced gyroscopes. Once a gyroscope is sent spinning,its axis always points in the same direction,even if you rotate it. For example,if the axis points toward the North Star,it will continue to point in that direction if you turn it upside down. This means that a spaceship,if it were to wander in its trajectory,can alter it’s rocket to compensate for this motion and return to its course. Goddard realized he could use gyroscopes to help keep his rockets on target. In 1926,he made history with the first very successfully launch of a liquid fueled rocket. It rose 41 feet into the air,flew for 2. 5 seconds,and landed 184 feet in a cabbage patch. WERNER VON BRAUNUnder Von Braun’s leadership,the scribblings and sketched of Tsiolkovsky’s and the prototypes of Goddard became the Vengeance Weapon 2 rocket,an advanced weapon of war that terrorized London and Antwerp,blowing up entire city blocks. The V-2 was unbelievably powerful. It dwarfed Goddard’s rockets,making them look like toys. The V-2 stood 46th feet tall and weighed 27,600 pounds. It could travel at a blazing speed of 3,580 miles per hour and it achieved a maximum altitude of about sixty miles. It hits it’s targets at three times the speed of sound,it broke the sound barrier. And it had an operational range of two hundred miles. The V-2 set a number of world records,shattering all past achievements in terms of speed and range for a rocket. It was the first long range guided ballistic missile. It was the first rocket to break the sound barrier. And most impressively,it was the first rocket ever to leave the boundary atmosphere and enter outer space. SPUTNIK AGEAfter the first Vanguard missile rise four feet into the air,then drop back down four feet,tip over,and destroy its own launchpad in huge,blinding expansion. The second Vanguard launch few months later also failed. In order to regain Russia reputation or sealed its government in Space race,Von Braun was ordered to quickly launch a satellite,Explorer 1,using the Juno 1 Missile. Sputnik 1 was the first artificial Earth satellite. The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on 4 October 1957. 1957:Sputnik 2 carried the first animal,a dog named Laika,into orbit.  1957:Lunik 1 was the first rocket to fly past the moon 1959:Lunik 2 was the first to hit the moon.  1959:Lunik 3was the first rocket to photograph the backside of the moon.  1960:Sputnik 5 had the first animals returned safely from space.  1961:Venera 1 was the first probe to fly past Venus. The Russian Space Program reached its crowning achievement when Yuri Gagarin safely orbited the Earth in 1961.  Note:Since space is premium,astronauts have historically been small people. Yuri Gagarin,for example,was only five feet two inches tall. He was the first person to go in Space. APOLLO MISSIONFirsts,there was the one manned craft called Mercury,and then the two manned Gemini,and finally the three- manned Apollo. Two types of Apollo Mission:Manned Mission and Unmanned Mission. Manned Mission:Apollo 7 to Apollo 17(only Apollo 13 failed the mission)Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969. Unmanned Mission:Apollo 18 to Apollo 20. NASA MISSION TO MARSDeep Space Gateway should be started construction from 2023. This will be used for fuel supplying station orbiting Moon. It will be operated in 2026. Astronauts aboard on Orion Space Capsule should halt at Deep Space Gateway. From this station,Rocket Propulsion system should be changed into Solar Electric propulsion. Unlike chemical engines,which can only for few minutes,ion engines can slowly accelerate for months or even years. The vehicle name will be “DeepSpaceTransport” MISCELLANEOUS MISSIONMeanwhile,SpaceX’s aspirational goal is to land the first humans on Mars by 2024. On September 14, 2018, SpaceX announced that a contracted passenger would be launched the BFR to flyby the Moon in 2023. The passenger is the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa. The Big Falcon Rocket is a privately funded, fully reusable launch vehicle and spacecraft system in development by SpaceX. In November 2018 the second stage and ship was renamed by Elon Musk to Starship, while the first stage was given the moniker “Super Heavy“The Chinese have announced that they will put their astronauts on the moon by 2025. Jeff Bezos,founder of Amazon and Blue Orgin(Aerospace Company) and owner of the Washington Post, also planned for tourist in space. Blue Origin has produced its own rocket system,called New Shepherd. ___Ref: Physics of the Impossible book by Michio Kaku, The future of Humanity book by Michio Kaku, Wikipedia, Space X webiste and NASA website "
